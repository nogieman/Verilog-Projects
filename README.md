# Semester 6 Code Repository

Welcome to my Semester 6 Code Repository! Here you'll find a collection of codes written during this semester, including assignments, lab work, and personal projects driven by my curiosity.

## Contents

1. **Assignment Codes**
   - Contains codes written for various assignments assigned during the semester.

2. **Lab Work**
   - Includes codes developed during lab sessions, experiments, and practical sessions.

3. **Personal Projects**
   - Houses codes for small projects and experiments initiated out of personal interest and curiosity.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the type of code:

- **/Sequential_Circuits**: Contains code files for sequential circuits such as counters, flip-flops, etc.
- **/Combinational_Circuits**: Holds code files for combinational circuits such as adders, multipliers, etc.
- **/Other_fun_Stuff**: Houses code files for personal projects such as pattern detectors.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codes and use them for reference or learning purposes. If you find anything useful or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contribute or provide feedback.
